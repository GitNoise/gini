			today. Across the world, income distribution varies widely from country to
			country, and the impact of this inequality is significant. When wealth
			becomes concentrated in the hands of a few, it can lead to economic
			instability, recession, and depression. This occurs because too much
			national income is diverted from the broader economy and accumulates among
			a small group of people.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1b15u9">Moreover, rising inequality empowers affluent countries, global
			corporations, and even wealthy individuals to shape global rules and
			resource allocation in their favor. With greater bargaining power, they
			are able to secure a larger share of global economic growth, reinforcing
			their position and further tilting international agreements and policies
			to their advantage. This dynamic perpetuates global inequality, as noted
			by philosopher Thomas Pogge in 2007.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-u4idq9">Ultimately, studying income inequality provides insight into the political
			economy of modern capitalism and sheds light on the direction in which our
			world is headed. Understanding these trends is crucial for policymakers
			and citizens alike as we work toward a more equitable future.</p> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-58z7rr"><img src="./assets/health-wealth.jpeg"> <figcaption>Maybe some other charts could go here?</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-m4tmsq">Gini coefficient</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-f92bwe">The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality used to quantify how
			evenly income or wealth is distributed within a society.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1l4ui1x">Named after the Italian statistician Corrado Gini, it is a number between
			0 and 1, where a Gini coefficient of 0 means perfect equality, everyone
			has the same income or wealth, and a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates
			perfect inequality, one person has all the income or wealth, while
			everyone else has none.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-2by67s">The Gini coefficient is calculated by comparing the expected income gap
			between any two randomly selected people to twice the mean income.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1s6ixjc">While the Gini coefficient is widely used to measure income inequality, it
			has limitations. It doesn&#39;t show the specific causes of inequality or
			account for the distribution&#39;s structure, and it may not capture extreme
			wealth concentration.</p>  <section id="scrolly" class="svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="container svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="chart-container svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="chart svelte-1f1wepv sticky"></div> <div class="steps svelte-1f1wepv"><div><div class="step svelte-1f1wepv active"><div class="contentwrapper svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentbackground svelte-1f1wepv"></div> <div class="content svelte-1f1wepv"><h3>World GINI Distribution</h3> <p>this is a text</p> </div></div> </div><div class="step svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentwrapper svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentbackground svelte-1f1wepv"></div> <div class="content svelte-1f1wepv"><h3>Split by region</h3> <p>highlight Africa</p> </div></div> </div><div class="step svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentwrapper svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentbackground svelte-1f1wepv"></div> <div class="content svelte-1f1wepv"><h3>1980s (0.517048557809601) </h3> <p>The era of 'Reaganomics' and 'Thatcherism' marked a global shift toward neoliberal policies, with deregulation, privatization, and tax cuts driving economic growth but also widening income inequality.</p> </div></div> </div><div class="step svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentwrapper svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentbackground svelte-1f1wepv"></div> <div class="content svelte-1f1wepv"><h3>1990s (0.5266535180758026)</h3> <p>Globalization and the rise of the Internet fueled rapid economic expansion, with the fall of the Soviet Union opening up new markets and technology companies beginning to transform the way business was conducted.</p> </div></div> </div><div class="step svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentwrapper svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentbackground svelte-1f1wepv"></div> <div class="content svelte-1f1wepv"><h3>2000s (0.5280147294473304)</h3> <p>The decade was characterized by the dot-com boom and bust, followed by a housing bubble, leading to a financial crisis in 2008 that triggered a global recession and prompted unprecedented government intervention to stabilize economies.</p> </div></div> </div><div class="step svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentwrapper svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentbackground svelte-1f1wepv"></div> <div class="content svelte-1f1wepv"><h3>2010s (0.5141499899160292)</h3> <p>The aftermath of the financial crisis saw a period of slow recovery, central bank stimulus, and the rise of new technologies like smartphones and social media, with continued globalization alongside a growing backlash against income inequality and global trade agreements.</p> </div></div> </div><div class="step svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentwrapper svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentbackground svelte-1f1wepv"></div> <div class="content svelte-1f1wepv"><h3>2020s (0.5139445614595645)</h3> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global economies, leading to massive government stimulus and shifts toward remote work, while renewed focus on climate change and social equity began to reshape business practices and international cooperation.</p> </div></div> </div><div class="step svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentwrapper svelte-1f1wepv"><div class="contentbackground svelte-1f1wepv"></div> <div class="content svelte-1f1wepv"><h3>Some European highlights</h3> <p>These countries are highlighted because I am trying out some new functionality.</p> </div></div> </div></div></div></div></div> </section> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1dnypr9">The Global Debate on Finance Capitalism</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-kbwk84">There has been a wave of neoliberal policies implemented worldwide
			beginning in the 1970s. Policies like deregulation, privatisation and the
			withdrawing of the state from social protection and welfare delivery
			became a common trend across different countries. Probably for the first
			time in economic history in the USA, the share of the national income of
			the top 1% fell from the 16% of pre-World War II rate, to less than 8% in
			the post-war era and stayed at the same level for almost three decades
			(Harvey, 2005). However, by the beginning of the 1970s a combination of
			slowing economic growth, the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of
			fixed exchange rates, ‘stagflation’ and high unemployment put severe
			strains on state budgets. ‘Keynesian compromise’ appeared to have reached
			its limits and other alternatives to overcome the emerging crisis were
			called on. For its proponents, the moment of neoliberalism had arrived.
			The Austro-German Marxist theoretician was the first to introduce the term
			‘finance capitalism’ and warned of the dangers associated with
			concentration of capital and the transformation of competitive capitalism
			into monopolistic finance capi- talism, thus anticipating the process of
			contemporary financialisation. In the latter, he writes of
			financialisation as ‘a prolonged split between the divergent real and
			financial economies’</p></section> </div></main> <footer></footer>
