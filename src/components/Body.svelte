      Income data was sourced from the <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://wid.world/wid-world/">World Inequality Database</a
      > (WID). It aims to provide open and convenient access to the most extensive
      available database on the historical evolution of the world distribution of
      income and wealth, both within countries and between countries. The WID combines
      different data sources: national accounts, survey data, fiscal data, and wealth
      rankings.

        >Pretax income</a
      > corresponds to income after the operation of social insurance systems, but
      before other types of redistribution. It is equal to factor income, plus pension
      benefits (17% of national income on average) and unemployment and disability
      benefits (1.7%), minus the social contributions that pay for them. Contributions
      and transfers are generally observed in survey data and can therefore be directly
      removed from or added to individual factor incomes.
